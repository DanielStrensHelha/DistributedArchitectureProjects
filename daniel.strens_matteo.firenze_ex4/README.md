In order to compile everything and start every necessary process,
    1 : Navigate to the root of the project.
    2 : Run the script Start.ps1 (windows : .\start.ps1).

When you want to stop the different processes:
    1 : Stop the monitor with <ctrl + C>.
    2 : Stop the main screen with the node's debugging messages in the same way.
    Every client should automatically close at this point as well.
